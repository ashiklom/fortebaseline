What scientific question is addressed in this manuscript?

Which processes and parameters are most important to accurately model community composition and C cycling in Upper Midwest temperate forests?
And, what is the relative importance of model structure (which processes are represented and how) versus model parameter values to these predictions?

What is/are the key finding(s) that answer this question?

Simulations that best matched present-day composition also most closely matched observed NPP and LAI, demonstrating the dependency of C fluxes on community composition. Parameter uncertainty was larger than structural uncertainty, but structure influenced the ecological dynamics within a given parameter set and affected which parameters were most influential.

Why is this work important and timely?

  abstract = {Abstract Plant traits – the morphological,
                  anatomical, physiological, biochemical and
                  phenological characteristics of plants and their
                  organs – determine how primary producers respond to
                  environmental factors, affect other trophic levels,
                  influence ecosystem processes and services and
                  provide a link from species richness to ecosystem
                  functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the
                  raw material for a wide range of research from
                  evolutionary biology, community and functional
                  ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global
                  database initiative named TRY, which has united a
                  wide range of the plant trait research community
                  worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of
                  trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been
                  contributed. The data repository currently contains
                  almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of
                  the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on
                  52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative
                  and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle,
                  including growth, dispersal, establishment and
                  persistence. A first data analysis shows that most
                  plant traits are approximately log-normally
                  distributed, with widely differing ranges of
                  variation across traits. Most trait variation is
                  between species (interspecific), but significant
                  intraspecific variation is also documented, up to
                  40\% of the overall variation. Plant functional
                  types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models,
                  capture a substantial fraction of the observed
                  variation – but for several traits most variation
                  occurs within PFTs, up to 75\% of the overall
                  variation. In the context of vegetation models these
                  traits would better be represented by state
                  variables rather than fixed parameter values. The
                  improved availability of plant trait data in the
                  unified global database is expected to support a
                  paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology,
                  offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait
                  research and enable a more realistic and empirically
                  grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in
                  Earth system models.},
